=================

This module defines a framework for incorporating values inspired by the six
“spirits” (or virtues) described in Isaiah 11:2 into decision-making
agents.  The goal of this framework is to help AI systems align their
behaviour with human‑centric values such as wisdom, understanding, good
planning (counsel), strength, knowledge, and reverence.  The module is
organised around three main constructs:

* **VirtueState** – a simple data container capturing the degree to which
  each virtue is expressed in a given situation.
* **VirtueEngine** – an abstract base class that defines the interface for
  computing a VirtueState from context and filtering candidate actions
  according to that state.
* **Example implementations** – a reference implementation of a concrete
  VirtueEngine and a simple demonstration applying the engine to
  hypothetical research‑assistant actions.  These examples are not meant to
  be production‑ready but illustrate how the abstract interface can be
  extended.

The emphasis of this design is on modularity and reusability.  Any AI
agent, regardless of its domain, can integrate a VirtueEngine to shape
its behaviour.  A specific agent (e.g. a literature‑review assistant) can
provide a specialised subclass of VirtueEngine to handle its own context
and actions while still adhering to the common interface.
